## Results (July 2024)

The target drain voltage is 24v (same as WA2EBY's design). 20W+ on 10 meters!

Note: A fan is REQUIRED when operating at 24v at home.

Transformer: 1T+1T:3T on two 61-material cylindrical cores (Fair-Rite
2661480002).

With drain @ 13.8v, we get 7W (after strong BPF) on the 10m meter band.
Current consumption is 1.5A. Gate driver @ 11.6v. With 20v drain, we generate
10W+ of clean RF output easily.

On 20m band, 13.8v drain easily gets us 14W of clean RF output after a strong
BPF.

On 15m band, 13.8v drain easily gets us 9W+ of clean RF output after a strong
BPF.
