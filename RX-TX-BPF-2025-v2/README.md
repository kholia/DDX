From failure to success reasons:

- Amazing guidance and confidence booster from VU2SPF at LARC 2024 conference

- Being able to measure things properly using my new DE-5000 LCR meter

- Choosing the right program (Elsie) and playing around with it

- Creating a feasible design

  Our previous design used a 27nH inductor - enough said ;)

- Seeing how inductance and capacitor values affect the response shape

- Elsie works much better (produces realistic filters) than Qucs Studio and

  tools.
