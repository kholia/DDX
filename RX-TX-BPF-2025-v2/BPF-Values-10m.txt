28 MHz
------

L1: 1.3uH needed. 18 turns on T50-6 measured 1.369uH.

CS1: 27pF needed. Cap measured 28.90pF.

CP1 (TDK disk ceramic, SL dielectric): Measured 120.7pF

L2: 18 turns on T50-6. Measured 1.356uH.

CS2 (WIMA FKP 2): Measured 34.29pF. Need 33pF.

CP2 (TDK disk ceramic, SL dielectric): Measured 120.6 pF

L3: 17T on FT50-6 measured 1.271uH. Since CS3 is a bit higher, L3 can be a bit
smaller. Confirmed response shape via Elsie.

CS3: Measured 29.99pF (should be 27pF).
